<!-- 

Make a loop that counts from 5 to 15 in the Console, in multiples of 3. 
 You can have this print below the loop in #2 above, or comment out the #2 code when you run this part.

Make a loop that counts by two, from 40 to 60. 

Alert the result, adding line breaks between lines (add the string "\n" in between each value).

 Make a loop that counts backwards from 100 to 0, and prints out in the Console.
Push the file(s) with all the above code to GitHub, set up GitHub Pages, and submit the URL below. -->
