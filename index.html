    <h1>How to confront Impostor Syndrome</h1>
    <p>"Do you feel like you're not a real developer? Do you beat yourself up for making simple mistakes in your code? Do you
            think you're not smart enough? That you're just not cut out for web development?"</p>
    <button onclick="survey();">Ask me questions</button>
    <p id="advice"></p>

</body>

</html>

If the user answered "yes" to question "D," add the following text to the string:

"Impostor syndrome thrives when all you do is think. Ask your boss, or a colleague or mentor who you trust, what they
think you’re doing well. Then ask if there is anything specific they feel you need to work on in the short-term, and
what measurable goals you might set to judge if you improved. Try setting some longer-term (3-6 months), measurable
goals with them as well."

If the user answered "yes" to question "E," add the following text to the string:

"You might be thinking about a project, or some code you wrote, that failed. Instead, try spending 20 minutes reflecting
on your successes so far, and remind yourself of how far you’ve come. This will help balance the scales of positive vs
negative self-talk that is at the heart of impostor syndrome."

After your last conditional statement, but still inside your "ask me questions" function, add the following expression:
document.getElementById("advice").innerHTML = advice;
This will locate the element with ID="advice" and paste the string you created inside.

Now, make the text more readable by separating the paragraphs. Add <p> and </p> tags to the string assignments above
(put the opening <p> tag right in front of each paragraph of text, inside the quotes, and the closing </p> inside the
quotes at the end of each paragraph). When the text is printed on the web page, the browser will read these as HTML.
Pretty nifty! -->
